# Statistics With Python Specialization

Welcome to my repository containing all the coursework and projects I've successfully completed as part of the Statistics with Python Specialization offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera.

**Course Rating: 5/5**

## Overview

Throughout this specialization, I've gained a deep understanding of statistical concepts and their practical implementation using Python. The courses in this specialization have equipped me with valuable skills in data analysis, visualization, inferential statistics, and advanced modeling techniques.

## Coursework Highlights

- **Course 1: Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python**
  In this foundational course, I mastered basic statistical measures and explored various data visualization techniques. I gained proficiency in using Python to analyze and visualize data, setting the stage for more advanced topics.

- **Course 2: Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python**
  Building upon my foundational knowledge, this course focused on inferential statistics. I learned how to confidently create confidence intervals, perform hypothesis testing, and interpret p-values. These skills allowed me to draw meaningful conclusions from sample data.

- **Course 3: Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python**
  The final course delved into the exciting realm of statistical modeling. I gained hands-on experience in linear regression, logistic regression, mixed models, and Bayesian statistics. These advanced techniques enabled me to model relationships, make predictions, and account for complex data structures.
